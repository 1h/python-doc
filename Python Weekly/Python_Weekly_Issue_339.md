[MusicVAE: Creating a palette for musical scores with machine learning.](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/music-vae)  
When a painter creates a work of art, she first blends and explores color options on an artist's palette before applying them to the canvas. This process is a creative act in its own right and has a profound effect on the final work. Musicians and composers have mostly lacked a similar device for exploring and mixing musical ideas, but we are hoping to change that. This post introduces MusicVAE, a machine learning model that lets us create palettes for blending and exploring musical scores.

[Breaking a Wine Glass in Python By Detecting the Resonant Frequency](https://www.makeartwithpython.com/blog/break-glass-with-resonant-frequency/)  
This post walks through the journey of writing a Python program to break wine glasses on demand, by detecting their resonant frequency. Along the way we'll 3D print a cone, learn about resonant frequencies, and see why I needed an amplifier and compression driver. So, let's get started.  
  
[Classes Without Classes](https://veriny.tf/classes-without-classes/)  
Python's object model is incredibly powerful; you can override virtually everything, or hand out weird objects to anyone and have them accept it as if it is a normal object. Python's OO is a descendant of smalltalk OO, where everything is an object, even objects and object types; especially functions. This made me wonder: is it possible to write classes without using classes?
